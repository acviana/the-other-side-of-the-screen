I'm a software engineer and engineering manager at [Terbium Labs](www.terbiumlabs.com), a dark web data intelligence start-up. Most of my engineering projects involve Python, SQL, and REST APIs. My background is in astronomy and I got my start in software engineering writing science and analysis software for the Hubble Space Telescope for 7 years.

I'm one of the organizers of the [Baltimore Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/baltimore-python/) (@PyBaltimore). I also occasionally volunteer as an instructor for [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) (@swcarpentry), where I help teach basic software engineering skills to researchers in science, engineering, and medicine.

Just like everyone else in the world, the ramblings on this blog do not represent the opinions of my esteemed employers past or present. Frankly, I'm lucky if anyone reads this at all.
