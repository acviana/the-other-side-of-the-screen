Hi, I'm Alex. I work in astronomy, at the intersection of data science, programming, and devops. Using mainly Python and SQL my work focuses on process automation and big data applications for the Hubble Space Telescope. I am employed by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) through the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA); please see my [disclaimer]({filename}/pages/disclaimer.md).

I'm also a volunteer instructor through [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/), where I help teach basic software skills to researchers in science, engineering, and medicine. I've led workshops at Columbia University, The National Center for Atmospheric Research, and the University of Baltimore Department of Pharmacy. Software Carpentry is funded in part through The Sloan Foundation and The Mozilla Foundation and is now part of The Mozilla Science Lab.

Needless to say (though apparently not) the views expressed here are mine alone and are not those of my employer, collaborators, or funding organization.

Lastly, while I do appreciate spelling and grammar, I'm not the best proof reader. Sorry. I hope any mistakes are merely hilarious and not too distracting.
